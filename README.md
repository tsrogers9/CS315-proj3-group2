# 315 Project 3

## prep
1. activate your virtual environment before running anything
2. cd into the directory 1-data_collection
2. All the urls for each profile is under the raw_data folder 

## how to run the comment scraper
1. go into VideoScraper.py
2. go to main, change the account name to what you are scraping
3. run the scraper and manually log in (sorry I wasn't able to bypass it with Eni's code)
4. leave it there until it's done scraping

Note that the webdriver would constantly bring you back to the chrome browser interface, so you 
probably want to not use your computer while running the code
